> free, accurate and unlimited speech recognition web app powered by Google's Web Speech API

[ðŸš€ launch app][launch]

## Motivation

In around 2016, the built-in voice recognition support for Cantonese in both Windows and macOS were not available yet. Even for Mandarin, the quality of recognition in both OS were far below Google. So I created this little webapp, harnessing Google web speech API, to serve my daily voice recognition need.

To speed up the operation, I added auto copy to clipboard and shortcut key feature afterwards. It then became a handy always-on utility on my computer.

Now, in 2022, the built-in voice recognition for both OS are mature enough that I can rely on them over 90% of time. However, the recognition quality of Google is still much better, especially in Cantonese. So I still come back to this tool when the OS fail to recognize those less common phases or slang.

## Features

demo ðŸŽ¬ https://youtu.be/D2NwsPozwFw

## Usage

- grant microphone and clipboard permission in Chrome

## Tech Details

ðŸ”— [source code][source]

It started with a single HTML file with internal css and javascript. As the project evolve I want to keep it simple and don't want to mess with bundler. This lead to the following tech stack selection:

- [UnoCSS][uno]: small, fast and flexible [tailwindcss][tailwind] alternative that support CDN
- [Alpine.js][alpine]: lightweight javaScript framework with CDN

### limitation

It uses Google's `webkitSpeechRecognition` api so it only works on Chrome OS / browser.
